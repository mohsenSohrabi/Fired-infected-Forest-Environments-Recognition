# Fired Infected Envirnment Recognition Using Keras
**Note**: In order to run this project you should download dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c1ADHs3uPMgQgoaAg36N--5-06FbFM23/view) and simply put it into "Dataset" folder. It is about 167MB and I can not put the file here directly to Dataset. 

### In this project we have 3 classes:
* Fired: There are lots of fired forest images here. In some of the pictures fire is obvious but in some other, the fire takes only a few parts of the picture. So that it is really hard to recognize fire in some samples.

* Infected: It includes pictures that there is some garbage accumulated in. Like the fired class, some of the samples are sophisticated to recognize.

* Clean: I includes a series of natural forest images.
